# FireTruck
The Center City fire department collaborates with the transportation department to maintain maps
of the city which reflects the current status of the city streets. On any given day, several streets are closed
for repairs or construction. Central City is divided into non-overlapping fire districts, each containing a single
firestation.When a fire is reported, a central dispatcher alerts the firestation of the district where the fire is located
and gives a list of possible routes from the firestation to the fire
â€“ Tools: Python, MobileNet, OpenCV.
